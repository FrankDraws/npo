        <h1>Organization's Mission & Goals</h1>
        <p>Our mission is to awaken the world to the reality of GOD and HIS KINGDOM by being HIS loving hands and heart. We are here to create real transformation of the heart by fulfilling HIS will, expressed through love, compassion, and good works that
            will manifest by serving people, animals, and nature in need.</p>

        <h3>Uniqueness of Purpose</h3>
        <p>While there are other faith based organizations that do good works in the name of JESUS, our uniqueness comes from not focusing on just one specific issue or need. GOD intended for HIS creation to be connected and this is the reason we'll serve
            people, animals, and nature in need.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We will create a network of good works and fellowship that will produce fruit.</li>
            <li>We will provide a genuine and meaningful way of serving that's relational.</li>
            <li>Modern living has severed and disrupted our connections to each other, animals, and nature. By serving one another and bearing each others burdens, along with helping animals and nature, we're living how life was intended to be. This will
                foster a genuine respect and love for each other and HIS creation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Studies have shown (cite studies) that interaction with animals and immersing ourselves in nature provides genuine health benefits.</p>
        <h1>Population Served </h1>
        <p>We will follow the need. First we seek and address situational circumstances such as lack of housing and food, drug addiction, orphaned children; neglected and abused animals, environmental issues, etc, by providing the necessary resources. Then,
            we will address issues of the heart in order to ignite the hope and love of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
