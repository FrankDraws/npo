            <h1>Organization's Mission & Goals</h1>
            <p>
                Our mission is to awaken the world to the reality of GOD and HIS
                KINGDOM by being HIS loving hands and heart. We are here to
                create real transformation of the heart by fulfilling HIS will,
                expressed through love, compassion, and good works that will
                manifest by serving people, animals, and nature in need.
            </p>

            <h3>Uniqueness of Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                While there are other faith based organizations that do good
                works in the name of JESUS, our uniqueness comes from not
                focusing on just one specific issue or need. GOD intended for
                HIS creation to be connected and this is the reason we'll serve
                people, animals, and nature in need.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    We will create a network of good works and fellowship that
                    will produce fruit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will provide a genuine and meaningful way of serving
                    that's relational.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Modern living has severed and disrupted our connections to
                    each other, animals, and nature. By serving one another and
                    bearing each others burdens, along with helping animals and
                    nature, we would be living life as it is intended to be.
                    This will foster a genuine respect and love for each other
                    and GOD's creation.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <p>Studies have shown (cite studies) that interaction with animals and immersing ourselves in nature provides genuine health benefits.</p> -->

            <h1>Population Served</h1>
            <p>
                We will follow the need. First we will seek and address
                situational circumstances such as lack of housing and food, drug
                addiction, orphaned children; neglected and abused animals,
                environmental issues, etc, by providing the necessary resources.
                Then, we will address issues of the heart in order to ignite the
                hope and love of JESUS CHRIST.
            </p>
