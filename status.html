        <p>The information below are things that I'm working on, questions I have, and so forth.</p>
        <h1>Nonprofit To Dos</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox" checked> Obtained business name</li>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox" checked> EIN</li>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox" checked> Opened bank account</li>

            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox"> <span class="highlight">Write bylaws [In Progress]</span></li>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox"> Narrative of Activities</li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
            <li class="sans"> <input type="checkbox"> Organizing document(?)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I think these are the Articles of Incorporation.</li>
                <li>This is in Part III of Form 1023.</li>
                <li>Articles of Incorporation include the type (charitable org), purpose, and dissolution provisions.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">May have to amend in order to increase chance of approval. Are there implications for this?.</span></li>
                <li>Must have IRS approved language in Articles of Incorporation.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h1>Miscellanea</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>How to get organized?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We need a system.</li>
                <li>Keep it as simple as possible.</li>
                <li>If using tech, try to avoid the cloud. At least large creepy corporations like Google.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h1>Questions</h1>
        <p>
            We can operate and even accept donations without tax exempt status. This means we have to opperate via the State of Florida. What does operating and taking donations without tax exemption look like? It's something I'm currently researching.
        </p>
        <p>We will help other nonprofits with funding, as well as collaborate, and assist. How does this affect how we fill out Form 1023?</p>
