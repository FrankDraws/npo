                    being HIS loving hands and heart, which will serve people,

                    We are GOD directed and we will glorify HIM by serving. We
                    are here to create real transformation of the heart by
                    fulfilling HIS will, expressed through love, compassion, and
                    good works. In practice, this will be carried out by helping
                    people in need, helping animals in need, and helping nature
                    in need. We are here to encourage and lift up HIS Children
                    so they can realize their full potential. We need to renew
                    the Spiritual connections to each other, animals, and nature
                    that have been severed by modern life. We do this, because
                    we love HIM.

                    transformation of the heart. Our organization has a simple
                    goal; to help people, animals, and nature in need. On a
                    global scale. This will be achieved by working directly with
                    individuals and collaborating with other nonprofits to
                    accomplish amazing things.

                    It may sound like too big a task, but this is coming from
                    the only ONE who can make anything happen. GOD HIMSELF!

                <p>What will your donation achieve?</p>

                    <li>
                        It will help people in need, be it homeless families,
                        single parents, orphans, mentally ill, and more.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        We will create an animal rescue to help animals in need
                        and find them loving homes.

                    <li>
                        We will also help nature by cleaning up public areas
                        such as beaches, wild life areas, and communities.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    But that's just the beginning. We will also raise funds for
                    other nonprofits that are doing GOD's work. Specifically,
                    nonprofits that are overlooked by public grants and other
                    organizations.
