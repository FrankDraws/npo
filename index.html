                We are currently in the process of obtaining our 501(c)(3) status.

            <p>We are <strong>Helping Hands For All Creatures Great And Small</strong>; a GOD directed nonprofit that is here to create real transformation of the heart. Our organization has a simple goal; to help people, animals, and nature in need. On
                a global scale. This will be accomplished by working directly with individuals and collaborating with other nonprofits to accomplish amazing things.</p>

            <p>It may sound like too big a task, but this is coming from the only ONE who can make anything happen. GOD HIMSELF! </p>

            <p>What will your donation achieve? </p>
            <ul>

                <li>It will help people in need, be it homeless families, single parents, orphans, mentally ill, and more.</li>

                <li>We will create an animal rescue to help animals in need and find them loving homes.</li>

                <li>We will also help nature by cleaning up public areas such as beaches, wild life areas, and communities.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But that's just the beginning. We will also raise funds for other nonprofits that are doing GOD's work. Specifically, nonprofits that are overlooked by public grants and other organizations.</p>

            <p>If you're donating money, pray and ask GOD how much you should give. If you want to donate supplies, provide resources, and/or volunteer, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

            <p>Let's come together and love our neighbors the way GOD intended, by being the <strong>Helping Hands for All Creatures Great And Small!</strong></p>
