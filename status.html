        <ul>
            <li class="sans"> <input type="checkbox"> Organizing document(?)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I think these are the Articles of Incorporation.</li>
                <li>This is in Part III of Form 1023.</li>
                <li>Articles of Incorporation include the type (charitable org), purpose, and dissolution provisions.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">May have to amend in order to increase chance of approval. Are there implications for this?.</span></li>
                <li>Must have IRS approved language in Articles of Incorporation.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h1>Miscellanea</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>How to get organized?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We need a system.</li>
                <li>Keep it as simple as possible.</li>
                <li>If using tech, try to avoid the cloud. At least large creepy corporations like Google.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h1>Questions</h1>
        <p>
            We can operate and even accept donations without tax exempt status. This means we have to opperate via the State of Florida. What does operating and taking donations without tax exemption look like? It's something I'm currently researching.
        </p>
        <p>We will help other nonprofits with fundraising, as well as collaborate, and assist. How does this affect us from an IRS standpoint? I noticed some language in Form 1023 that seems to ask about giving money</p>

        <p>The IRS asks if we'll be "publishing" things such as artwork. I was thinking of selling merchandise in order to help raise funds. How do we present this? Do we have to decide the exact business model for this now? For example, will we sell merch
            only created by me? Or will we ask local artist to donate work for us?</p>
