        <p>The information below are things that I'm working on, questions I have, and so forth.</p>
        <h1>Nonprofit To Dos</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox" checked> Obtained business name</li>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox" checked> EIN</li>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox" checked> Opened bank account</li>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox" checked> Article of Incorporation</li>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox"> Write bylaws [In Progress]</li>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox"> Narrative of Activities</li>
            <ul>
                <li>May have to amend in order to increase chance of approval.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>


        <ul>
            <li class="sans"> <input type="checkbox"> Organizing document(?)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I think these are the Articles of Incorporation.</li>
                <li>This is in Part III of Form 1023.</li>
                <li>Articles of Incorporation include the type (charitable org), purpose, and dissolution provisions.</li>
                <li>We might have to send an amendment in to State of Florida (Are there implications for this?).</li>
                <li>Must have IRS approved language in Articles of Incorporation.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h1>Miscellanea</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="sans"><input type="checkbox"> How to get organized?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We need a system.</li>
                <li>Keep it as simple as possible.</li>
                <li>If using tech, try to avoid the cloud. At least large creepy corporations like Google.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h1>Questions</h1>
        <p>
            We are a charitable organization, but are we educational too? Maybe what the IRS defines as educational isn't the same as what we think it is.
        </p>
        <p>We will help other nonprofits with funding, as well as collaborate, and assist. How does this affect how we fill out Form 1023?</p>
